# finom

My gists for fun and ~production~!

If you want to use some of my gists (for some weird reason):

1. Install this module via `npm install finom`.
2. Make sure that the gist is named as `[finom/NAME] SOME_TEXT`.
3. Use the gist by importing `finom/NAME`

```js
// finom - is the package name
// something - gist name (extracted from gist description)
// Something - gist file
import Something from 'finom/something/Something';
```
